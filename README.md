# Algorithm
Java implementation of basic data structures and algorithms

1. Print all positive integer solutions to the equation a3 + b3 c3 + d3 where a, b, c, and d are integers between 1 and 1000.

2. Given a smaller strings and a bigger string b, design an algorithm to find all permutations of the shorter string within the longer one.Print the location of each permutation.
